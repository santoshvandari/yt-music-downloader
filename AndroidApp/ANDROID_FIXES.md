# Android Download Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Storage Permissions (Android API 30+)
**Problem**: The app was using outdated storage permissions that don't work on modern Android versions.

**Solution**:
- Added `permission_handler` dependency for proper permission management
- Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` with modern permissions:
  - `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` for Android 13+ (API 33+)
  - Kept legacy permissions for older versions
- Added runtime permission checking and requesting in `DownloaderProvider`

### 2. File Storage Location
**Problem**: App tried to access `/storage/emulated/0/Download` which requires scoped storage handling.

**Solution**:
- Changed to use app-specific external storage directory (`getExternalStorageDirectory()`)
- Creates a `Music` folder within the app's external directory
- This doesn't require special permissions and files are accessible to other apps
- Added proper directory creation and write permission testing

### 3. Playlist Download Logic
**Problem**: Playlist downloads could fail due to poor error handling and async iteration issues.

**Solution**:
- Improved async handling with proper `await for` loop for video discovery
- Added individual video error handling - if one video fails, continue with the rest
- Better progress reporting during playlist discovery
- Enhanced logging for debugging playlist issues

### 4. File Saving Robustness
**Problem**: Files could fail to save without proper error reporting.

**Solution**:
- Added write permission testing before download
- Verify file exists and has content after download
- Better error messages for permission and storage issues
- Improved file path handling and directory creation

## New Features Added
